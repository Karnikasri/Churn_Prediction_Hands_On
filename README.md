# Churn Prediction Hands-On
## About
This repository contains an end-to-end hands-on project for customer churn prediction using machine learning techniques. The project primarily uses Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation focused on churn analysis.

## Project Highlights
Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer churn data
Feature engineering tailored to improve model accuracy
Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest)
Model evaluation with metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
Visualizations and interpretation of model outcomes
Interactive notebook format for easy understanding and reproducibility

## Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn)
Machine Learning algorithms for classification
## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Yiannis Pi for the excellent video tutorials that inspired and guided the development of this customer churn prediction project.
